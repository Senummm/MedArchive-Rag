# Clinical Practice Guideline: Hypertension Management

**Version:** 2024.1  
**Effective Date:** January 2024  
**Review Date:** January 2025

## Executive Summary

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adult patients. Key recommendations include:

- Screen all adults aged 18+ for hypertension
- Target blood pressure <140/90 mmHg for most patients
- Initiate lifestyle modifications for all patients
- Start pharmacological therapy based on risk stratification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Hypertension affects approximately 1 in 3 adults worldwide and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. Early detection and appropriate management significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### 1.2 Scope

This guideline covers:
- Screening and diagnosis
- Risk assessment
- Non-pharmacological interventions
- Pharmacological treatment
- Monitoring and follow-up

### 1.3 Target Audience

- Primary care physicians
- Internal medicine specialists
- Cardiologists
- Nurse practitioners
- Clinical pharmacists

## 2. Diagnosis and Screening

### 2.1 Blood Pressure Measurement

**Proper Technique:**
1. Patient seated comfortably for 5 minutes
2. Arm supported at heart level
3. Appropriate cuff size
4. Two readings, 1-2 minutes apart

**Classification:**

| Category | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Normal | <120 | <80 |
| Elevated | 120-129 | <80 |
| Stage 1 HTN | 130-139 | 80-89 |
| Stage 2 HTN | ≥140 | ≥90 |
| Hypertensive Crisis | >180 | >120 |

### 2.2 Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnosis requires:
- Elevated BP on ≥2 occasions
- Confirmed by ambulatory or home BP monitoring when possible
- Rule out white coat hypertension

## 3. Initial Assessment

### 3.1 History and Physical Examination

**Essential History Elements:**
- Duration of hypertension
- Prior treatments and responses
- Cardiovascular risk factors
- Target organ damage symptoms
- Secondary hypertension screening

**Physical Examination:**
- Multiple BP measurements
- Fundoscopic examination
- Cardiovascular examination
- Peripheral pulses and bruits
- BMI calculation

### 3.2 Laboratory Evaluation

**Baseline Testing:**
- Complete metabolic panel
- Lipid profile
- Hemoglobin A1C or fasting glucose
- Urinalysis
- ECG

**Additional Testing (when indicated):**
- Echocardiography
- Renal ultrasound
- Plasma renin/aldosterone ratio
- 24-hour urine cortisol

## 4. Treatment Approach

### 4.1 Risk Stratification

Calculate 10-year cardiovascular risk using validated tools:
- Pooled Cohort Equations
- Framingham Risk Score
- SCORE2 (European)

**Risk Categories:**
- Low risk: <5% 10-year risk
- Moderate risk: 5-10% 10-year risk
- High risk: >10% 10-year risk

### 4.2 Treatment Targets

**General Population:**
- Target: <140/90 mmHg
- More intensive target (<130/80) may benefit high-risk patients

**Special Populations:**
- Diabetes: <130/80 mmHg
- Chronic kidney disease: <130/80 mmHg
- Age ≥65 years: <130/80 mmHg (if tolerated)

## 5. Non-Pharmacological Interventions

### 5.1 Lifestyle Modifications

**Dietary Approaches:**
- DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)
- Sodium restriction (<2.3g/day, ideally <1.5g/day)
- Potassium-rich foods (if no contraindications)
- Limit alcohol consumption

**Physical Activity:**
- 150 minutes moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week
- Resistance training 2-3 days per week
- Reduce sedentary time

**Weight Management:**
- Target BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- Even modest weight loss (5-10%) improves BP

**Stress Management:**
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)
- Smoking cessation

### 5.2 Expected BP Reductions

| Intervention | Expected SBP Reduction |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Weight loss (per 1kg) | 1 mmHg |
| DASH diet | 8-14 mmHg |
| Sodium restriction | 2-8 mmHg |
| Physical activity | 4-9 mmHg |
| Alcohol moderation | 2-4 mmHg |

## 6. Pharmacological Treatment

### 6.1 First-Line Agents

**ACE Inhibitors:**
- Mechanism: Block angiotensin-converting enzyme
- Examples: Lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril
- Side effects: Dry cough (10%), angioedema (rare)
- Contraindications: Pregnancy, bilateral renal artery stenosis

| Drug | Starting Dose | Target Dose | Maximum Dose |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Lisinopril | 10 mg daily | 20-40 mg daily | 40 mg daily |
| Enalapril | 5 mg daily | 10-20 mg daily | 40 mg daily |
| Ramipril | 2.5 mg daily | 5-10 mg daily | 10 mg daily |

**Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs):**
- Mechanism: Block angiotensin II receptors
- Examples: Losartan, valsartan, telmisartan
- Side effects: Generally well-tolerated, rare angioedema
- Preferred over ACE-I if cough develops

| Drug | Starting Dose | Target Dose | Maximum Dose |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Losartan | 50 mg daily | 100 mg daily | 100 mg daily |
| Valsartan | 80 mg daily | 160 mg daily | 320 mg daily |
| Telmisartan | 40 mg daily | 80 mg daily | 80 mg daily |

**Calcium Channel Blockers:**
- Types: Dihydropyridines (amlodipine) vs. non-dihydropyridines (diltiazem)
- Mechanism: Block calcium channels, reduce vascular resistance
- Side effects: Peripheral edema, constipation, gingival hyperplasia

| Drug | Starting Dose | Target Dose | Maximum Dose |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Amlodipine | 5 mg daily | 10 mg daily | 10 mg daily |
| Diltiazem ER | 180 mg daily | 240-360 mg daily | 480 mg daily |

**Thiazide Diuretics:**
- Examples: Hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone
- Mechanism: Reduce plasma volume
- Side effects: Hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia
- Monitoring: Electrolytes, particularly potassium

| Drug | Starting Dose | Target Dose | Maximum Dose |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Hydrochlorothiazide | 12.5 mg daily | 25 mg daily | 50 mg daily |
| Chlorthalidone | 12.5 mg daily | 25 mg daily | 25 mg daily |

### 6.2 Treatment Algorithm

**Stage 1 Hypertension:**
1. Start with single first-line agent
2. Titrate to maximum tolerated dose
3. Add second agent if BP not controlled after 1 month

**Stage 2 Hypertension:**
1. Start with two first-line agents (combination therapy)
2. Preferred combinations:
   - ACE-I/ARB + calcium channel blocker
   - ACE-I/ARB + thiazide diuretic
   - Calcium channel blocker + thiazide diuretic

**Resistant Hypertension:**
- Definition: BP not controlled on 3 medications including diuretic
- Add spironolactone 25-50mg daily
- Consider referral to hypertension specialist

### 6.3 Special Considerations

**Pregnancy:**
- Safe options: Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine
- Avoid: ACE-I, ARBs, spironolactone

**Chronic Kidney Disease:**
- Prefer ACE-I or ARB for renoprotection
- Monitor potassium and creatinine closely
- Avoid NSAIDs

**Heart Failure:**
- ACE-I/ARB mandatory unless contraindicated
- Add beta-blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate)
- Consider spironolactone

## 7. Monitoring and Follow-up

### 7.1 Initial Phase

- Follow-up every 2-4 weeks until BP controlled
- Check electrolytes 2-4 weeks after starting/adjusting diuretics or ACE-I/ARB
- Assess medication adherence and adverse effects

### 7.2 Maintenance Phase

**Once BP Controlled:**
- Follow-up every 3-6 months
- Annual laboratory monitoring
- Assess target organ damage annually
- Reinforce lifestyle modifications

**Home Blood Pressure Monitoring:**
- Recommended for all patients
- Target: <135/85 mmHg
- Record weekly averages
- Bring log to appointments
